## Security Reminder ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Your API token has been exposed in terminal history.** For security:

1. **Delete the token** from PyPI:
   - Go to: https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens
   - Click "Remove" on the "long screen seg" token

2. **Create a new token** with project-specific scope:
   - Only applies to this project
   - Safer if accidentally leaked

3. **Store securely** in future:
   - GitHub Actions Secrets (for CI/CD)
   - Local `~/.pypirc` (never commit to git)
   - Environment variables
